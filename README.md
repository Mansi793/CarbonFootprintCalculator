# CarbonFootprintCalculator

## Our Approach

In this project, we have employed a methodology that integrates traditional techniques with state-of-the-art IoT technologies, aiming to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and real-time monitoring capabilities. The system operates by collecting, storing, and analyzing sensor data in the cloud, leveraging advanced IoT platforms like ThingSpeak.

To complement this, we've developed ThingView, a mobile application enabling users to visualize and monitor data from ThingSpeak channels on their mobile devices. The integration of NodeMCU with Wi-Fi capability further streamlines the implementation of IoT projects.

Critical sensors for temperature, humidity, carbon, and hydrocarbons play a vital role in detecting gases like carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), significant contributors to the carbon footprint.

Our method brings together the simplicity of traditional approaches and the advanced capabilities of IoT technologies, providing a comprehensive solution for carbon footprint calculation. Nevertheless, further research and analysis are imperative to ascertain the effectiveness of this approach in accurately calculating the carbon footprint.
